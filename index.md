# Tom's Site

Welcome to my site.  There's a bunch of odds and ends scattered around here, I hope you find what you're looking for. 
If you search long enough there's some cool stuff.

This is my **new** site (see how long this stays here!), still pulling things in, and it will probably never be 
"finished".


I'm active on [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/teeks99), <a rel="me" href="https://fosstodon.org/@teeks99">Mastodon</a>, and more.

I have a seperate page I keep for my work building boost for windows and a tumblr that tries to document what I'm doing with boost builds.
If you want to contact me securely, you can use my [PGP/GPG Key](Thomas Kent (Tom) teeks99@yahoo.com (0xFB6194A8) pub.asc) (use the 4096RSA one) which has the following fingerprint:

        Key fingerprint = 8AB6 F852 C418 5476 28E0  EA3F 71C6 6BB5 9520 7C90
