Want to learn programming, but can only read at a 3rd grade level (maybe you're in 3rd grade) and get overloaded by 
the thought of a screen full of code...then Scratch is for you. It is a full-featured programming language built to 
work graphically. It is nice, visual, components that can easily be stacked together (only in ways that actually work)
to form programs.

It comes with a bunch of nice extras to do graphical things, move sprites around, backgrounds, etc.  You can even make 
it play sounds...which 3rd graders love.
