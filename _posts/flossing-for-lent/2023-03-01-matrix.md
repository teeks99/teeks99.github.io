There are a ton of ways to send someone a message on your phone. Email, SMS, you're phone OS provider's choice 
(iMessage or Google Chat), WhatsApp, Discord, etc. These all have big downsides. After searching far and wide, I'm 
ready to declare that the Matrix system is the answer. 

It provides a rich method of communication for individuals and groups. Voice/Video calls/rooms, complete security and 
privacy, ability to use from any device, no need to link to a phone number. That's all the boxes I need to check, so
come join me `@teeks99:matrix.org`!
