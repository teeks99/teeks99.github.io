The Open Broadcaster Software (OBS) studio is the software you want to use to host a live stream. It works great for 
desktop sharing (including video games) as well as for broadcasting webcams. It has built in support for sending to 
popular service like youtube and twitch, but also works with just about anything else out there. 

It can take in lots of different sources, live cameras, desktop, pre-recorded videos, static images, and lots of 
sound inputs. These can be switched between or even combined into the same output stream. 

During the worst of the pandemic, I was using this to stream my church's services every week. We would switch between
multiple different cameras and have various screens showing information. It worked very well.
