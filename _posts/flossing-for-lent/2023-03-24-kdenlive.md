Kdenlive is a great, full featured, video editor. I am not a professional video editor, but every time I want to do 
something (more advanced than just cutting or re-compressing video), Kdenlive has the feature to do it. Fading between 
tracks, check. Compositing multiple streams together, check. Adding all forms of graphics over video, check. ...and a 
ton more too.
