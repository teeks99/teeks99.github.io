Jellyfin is a media management tool. It is great for TV, Music, Movies, Pictures, and just about anything else you can
think of. It can look at files already in your file system, but the beauty is you can access it all from a web browser 
or an app on your smartphone/tablet.

If you've spent time collecting media, you can use this to view it all. It is a bit like having your own netflix, 
except instead of paying every month, you have access to all the stuff you've already paid for.
