I have a nifty weather station in my back yard. It has a nice wireless receiver that will tell us see what the 
temperature and other readings are from our kitchen. However, that's only good if I'm in the kitchen. I always have my 
phone with me, even around the house. I'd love to be able to see that temperature right when I get up in the morning.

Weewx is the software that turns my weather station's data into a website that I can see from anywhere. It includes 
lots of historical data as well, so I can see what thing were like over the last day/week/month. This is especially 
important when I'm trying to understand how much rain has fallen on our garden. 

It also lets me publish my data to other websites, like weather underground.
