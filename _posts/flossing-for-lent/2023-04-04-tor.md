TOR (The Onion Router) is a relatively old network that runs on top of the internet. It was built to give people who
live in repressive regimes a way to get their voice onto the internet, anonymously, even when it is highly filtered.

This is still a huge part of what it does, and why I'm still a fan of it. However, I'd be remiss not to mention the 
down-side to this technology that is constantly getting bigger. It is a haven for cyber-criminals. Because of the 
privacy guarantees it gives, they have used it, with mixed success, to stay beyond the arm of the law. 

I wouldn't immediately recommend it to anyone's kids...there is a lot of bad stuff out there. On the other hand I 
*would* recommend it to anyone who works as a journalist or in any foreign country that may not share our value system.
