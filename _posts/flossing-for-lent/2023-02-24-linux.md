Unlike most other applications that I'll be talking about, Linux isn't something you can just sit down and install on
your computer. It can be installed on most PCs as part of a distribution , for example Ubuntu, Red Hat Enterprise Linux,Debian, Raspbian, or hundreds more. Thatâ€™s not all though, it also powers the vast majority of the web servers on the 
internet. Each time you go to google.com you are interacting with a Linux computer. It also runs all Android phones. It 
even runs things like cars, airplanes, and spacecraft. 

Linux is a fundamental building block for running modern computing devices, so you might not be ready to install a 
distribution on your PC, but you can appreciate all the functionality that is has already brought you.
