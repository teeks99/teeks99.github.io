AntennaPod is a simple, fully functional, podcast client for Android. It does everything you'd want a podcast client to,
so why look elsewhere? At some silly, locked-in, client like spotify?!? 

I've been listening to podcasts since the dawn of the industry, with the pod-father himself, Adam Curry. The
 ~~biggest~~ incredibly huge change in that time has been moving from having the client be on a PC, then transferring 
 each episode to a mp3 player...to having a fully-connected phone as the client and player. I went through a few 
 clients in the early days, but they often got annoying or naggy...everyone trying to make a quick buck off an Android
 app. Another great advantage of open source, the business models around it don't depend on annoying you into 
 submission. I found AntennaPod and never looked back.

I've got a stable of podcasts I listen to weekly, but am frequently trying new ones and stopping old ones. AntennaPod 
has a great UI for doing this, and all the other features I'd expect from any podcast player.
