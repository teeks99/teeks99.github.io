Online maps, especially open ones like Open Street Map, are amazing. They have way better detailed views than the 
atlases I used to spend time studying as a kid. The huge drawback to them is, they only work if you have an internet 
connection. Which you obviously won't have that one time when you're on some back-country road, lost in the middle of 
the night. 

OsmAnd takes the amazing map built by the open street map community and makes it available offline, so you don't need 
an internet connection to use it. You can just download regions you will be in (by state, or country) and you're all 
set.
