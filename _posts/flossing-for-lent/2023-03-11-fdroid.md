A few days back, I mentioned that one of the freedoms of the Android operating system is that it will let you install 
any software you like. Where do you get this software? Answer: F-Droid. This is a repository/store, just like the 
Google Play store, where you can browse through and find apps that are interesting to you. 

The beauty of F-Droid is that all the packages there are open source and vetted by the community. This makes it very 
unlikely that malware will slip into your system, a constant threat in the Google Play store (though Google does a 
lot to prevent and mitigate that).

This is where I get most of the apps I use every day on my phone. You may have noticed links here in the previous blog 
posts, I've been including them when I remember.
