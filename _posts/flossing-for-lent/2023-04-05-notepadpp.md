Notepad++ is the master of editing "plain text" files. These are files, unlike Word documents, that just are a 
collection characters in a file. Microsoft's notepad app will work in a pinch, but Notepad++ provides tons of useful 
stuff that makes it a breeze to work with these files.

These plain text files are a huge part of what I type into computers. Often computer code, but more recently tons of 
markdown too. I also take all my notes in plain text. Notepad++ provides nice syntax highlighting for all this, great
abilities to change EOL types, and all the geeky stuff that a real text editor should include.
