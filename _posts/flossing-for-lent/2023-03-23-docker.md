Docker has revolutionized how software is rolled out into services. Having, basically, a complete operating system as
a building block to layer on top of for a single application is nothing short of amazing. Being able to mix and match 
those, start them nearly instantly, and automatically scale them to the span of the internet, revolutionary.

I've used docker for server completely different types of work. The typical, running a service on a PC (I've had great
luck with docker-compose, dipped my toe in the waters of Kubernetes). But less typical as well. Using it as a constant 
framework for executing C++ tests of the boost framework in hundreds of different configurations. Building tools on 
windows in a headless setup.
