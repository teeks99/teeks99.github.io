VLC (Video Lan Client) is an amazing media player! I've been using this awesome tool for more than 20 years as my go-to
video player. It has a great reputation for being able to play anything you can throw at it. It is easy to install and
doesn't get its hooks all over your system. It has great default settings, but is also completely configurable to work
however you need it. 

It can also do a ton of advanced things, like recording your screen, streaming video, and re-compressing.
