Security on most websites is all about having a strong password, and not using it on more than one site. Bitwarden is
a tool to help you do this well. It is a very secure database of all your logins and passwords, but also has nifty 
plugins for browsers as well as apps for devices that make it work really smoothly. It is a ton easier than keeping a 
text file with all the passwords, opening that up when you need one and pasting it into the site.

The bitwarden clients and server are all open source, but if you don't want to host it yourself, you can just pay the 
company a small amount to have them host it for you. This is a great open source business model!
