Jitsi is a fully open-source video conferencing solution, just like zoom, except you can have full control.

I'm still shocked that Zoom was the thing people jumped onto in the pandemic. There were several other options, but 
somehow this is the one that took off. Jitsi was technically superior at the time, and because it was fully open source
would have been very easy for organizations (schools, companies, etc) to take an customize to their own liking. Yet 
somehow we still deal with zoom and their super-fun 40 minute limit on a daily basis.
