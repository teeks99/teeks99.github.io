Super Tux Kart is a great Mario Kart clone. If you feel like some racing fun, check it out. 

It comes with a bunch of courses, and is playable on lots of different platforms. I've played on my PC, from my couch,
on a tablet, and on a phone. For each of these platforms, they have different control inputs. For instance, if you have 
phone with gyros/accelerometers in it, you can turn the phone like a steering wheel to control it. 

Fun for all ages!
