wX provides a great interface to the radar maps provided by the National Weather Service. There are a ton of other
weather apps out there, but they are pretty much all terrible. They either are slow and laggy or have tons of 
advertisements that preclude a good UI...or both. 

wX is a full weather app, based on the data that the National Weather Service makes freely available (thanks taxpayer!).
It is the same data that all the other apps are parroting back, just does a much better job of doing it well.
