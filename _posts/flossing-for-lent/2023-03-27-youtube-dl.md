There are so many good video services out there these days. Unfortunately, they mostly depend on you being online to 
watch the videos. Youtube-dl (and its nicer fork yt-dlp) solve this problem. You can point it at a video on any of 
dozens of sites, and it will download it so you can watch while offline.

I mostly restrict my kids to watching videos from PBS (they've got a ton of great stuff!), but for long car trips, 
when I most want them to binge videos, they don't have a way to access the website. I was able to use yt-dlp to copy a 
bunch of the videos to my computer, then used syncthing to mirror them onto the appropriate tablet for the kid who 
likes each particular show.
