This lent, I'm going to be posting about one Free Software or Open Source (also known as FLOSS - Free, Libre, or Open
Source Software) software package every day. Free Software is important to me. Why? Two reasons:

1.  We need to have control of the software we depend on. "Free" in this context isn't referring to the price, but 
    should be taken in the sense of "Liberty", this software is free to use as you see fit. We have the control of this
    critical tool we depend on.
2.  This is a great way to make sure that all people can have the same tools (here, the free of cost aspect helps!)
    around the world. When I lived in Bolivia, it was a struggle for people to get a copy of word to write a school
    paper in. In the world where everyone is using FLOSS, that struggle for the disadvantaged goes away.

Check back every day for the rest of lent for the latest update.
