Signal is the first messaging app to get encryption right, and still the most popular one around. There are lots of other apps for messaging that claim to be secure, but often aren't, especially all the ones from the big names (Facebook, Google, Apple, Telegram). They have all made serious design choices that compromise their security and privacy, to try to make the user experience "nicer". That's the choice they need to make, but I'd prefer they didn't.
