Mastodon is a reformulation of Twitter so that it can be controlled by the community, not a single corporation. Instead
of a single site you go to, it is a "Federation" of different sites. When you post in one, that post gets transported 
to any other sites that has someone who follows you. If you just want to browse around, by default and without 
following anyone, you'll see the posts on the site that is your home. Thus, it can be useful to find a home site that
matches your interests.

I have an interest in Free/Open Source software, so I've got my `teeks99` account on the `fosstodon.org` server. If you 
want to follow/mention/etc me, you can use the address `@teeks99@fosstodon.org`, but if you just want to see my 
account, you can browse to https://fosstodon.org/@teeks99.
