GCompris is the best set of educational software for kids around. Most educational apps are littered with ads or in-app
purchases. Because this is open source, there isn't any of that. This just has a dedication to creating apps that are
beneficial to lots of different kids.

Inside this one app (for your phone/tablet or your PC), there are a ton of sub-apps targeting all kinds of activities. 
From very basic things of naming animals, colors, letters, numbers...all the way up to complex things like building 
virtual electrical circuits. There are apps that are very learning focused, some that are a even mix of fun and 
learning, and some that are just fun!
