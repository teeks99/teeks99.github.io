Libre Office is an office suite that can provide a FLOSS replacement for the standard Microsoft Tools: Word, Excel,
Powerpoint. Not very flashy or exciting, but a huge leveler for anyone who can't afford the high price of the 
Microsoft Office suite. It has pretty much all the features you've ever used from the MS versions and great document
compatibility. It defaults to using its own "OpenDocument" formats for files, but can just as easily open/edit/save the 
Microsoft .doc/.docx, .xls/.xlsx, .ppt/.pptx file formats.
