Ubuntu is a linux distribution with the tagline "Linux for Human Beings". It has long been my favorite because of their
goal of being an enabler for people everywhere. When it was started most linux distros were focused around businesses 
or hobbyists. Ubuntu was different because its goal was to give users a FLOSS alternative to windows in all the places
where people were comfortable with it, thereby bringing freedom into their lives. I started using it around 2008, and I 
haven't looked back, it has been a great journey.
