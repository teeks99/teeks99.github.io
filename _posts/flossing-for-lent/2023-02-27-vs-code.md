Visual Studio Code is a text editor, originally developed by Microsoft, but released under an Open Source license, that
is a world-class development environment for many types of software/computer development tasks. At its core, it is still
a text editor (like notepad), but it has a ton of capabilities that make it amazing for working with code, data, 
configuration files and lots more. It also has a huge set of extensions that can be downloaded and installed in it, 
created by all kinds of people in the community, that supercharge its abilities to interact with languages and tools.
