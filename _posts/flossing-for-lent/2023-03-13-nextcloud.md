One of the great revolutions in the last ~10 years is the ability to leverage cloud services for your day-to-day 
activities. Google Drive/Docs, Dropbox, iMessage, Google Calendar, etc. The **huge** downside to these is that you are 
trusting everything to these big companies, that often don't have your interests at heart.

Nextcloud is a way to take control back and have your own cloud service to do all these things. It is simple to setup 
(or pay someone a small amount to take care of for you) and has tons of important features:

*   User accounts - Setup accounts for everyone in your family, co-workers, etc
*   File storage - sync files from your phone to PC, share among multiple users
*   Photo sync - Upload photos to albums as they are taken on your phone
*   Document editing - Collaboratively edit documents, spreadsheets, presentations
*   Chat - Text, Voice, and Video calls, including groups
*   Calendar, Contacts, Bookmarks, News, Note Taking, Mapping and many more
