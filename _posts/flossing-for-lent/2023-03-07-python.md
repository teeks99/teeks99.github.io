I've used many programming languages over the years, the one that I find the most enjoyable is easily Python. It is so 
very easy to do **so** much there. 

Like any language, as you start to solve big, complex, problems with it, you will end up with big, complex, code. I 
don't think any traditional language will ever solve that problem. But even in that case, python keeps it neat and 
organized...greatly helped by the amazing framework that it comes with. 

Recently, I had to test out a bunch of multicast sockets. The default option I had was to spend a couple days building
up the test case in C++. Instead I was able to pull together a bunch of python code that did the same thing in less 
than an hour.

*   [Hitchhiker's Guide to Python](https://docs.python-guide.org/) - Good reference
*   [Python Module of the Week (PyMOTW)](https://pymotw.com/3/) - Lots of examples of using the standard library
