Tux Paint is a very fun painting program for kids. All the basics of a painting program: changing brushes, colors, etc. 
but also fun stamps and shapes you can apply. 

Great for little kids who are just learning to use a tablet and want to see color on the screen where they push. But 
can quickly grow to doing more engaging artistic activities.
