Happy Easter! If you're just picking up now, my Lent goal was to write something about a different Free, Libre, Open 
Source (FLOSS) application every day for lent...and I made it!

For each of those posts, I put a (slightly different due to formatting limitations) excerpt to the following places:

*   [Reddit's r/opensource subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/)
*   Matrix.org's foss_discussion channel
*   Twitter
*   Mastodon
*   Facebook

By far the most engagement I got was in the Reddit subreddit. Followed by my facebook page. I got a tiny amount on the
Matrix channel and almost nothing on Twitter/Mastodon (maybe because I've never really posted to those sites before,
so don't have any followers?).  


# Tom vs. the AIs

Over the last few months, there has been a rise of AI websites that can generate things. Mostly at this point that is 
either writing or images. I used [OpenAI's DALL-E generator](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/images) (note, 
OpenAI is *not* open in any of the senses used in FLOSS) to generate the graphic for this post, fun!

However, I wanted to see how smart these different writing generators could be. I've spent thousands of hours over the past ~20 years in the FLOSS community, reading about different applications, trying them, even contributing back to 
them. I'd like to think that the list I came up with this lent is pretty well informed, while realizing that if I asked
anyone else in the community to come up with a similar list there would definitely be differences.

If you haven't been following all lent, here's the list I came up with:

*   Firefox
*   Linux
*   Libre Office
*   VS Code
*   Android
*   Matrix
*   GIMP
*   Ubuntu
*   VLC
*   Inkscape
*   Python
*   OBS
*   Handbrake
*   Super Tux Kart
*   F-Droid
*   Nextcloud
*   WeeWx
*   OsmAnd
*   Jellyfin
*   Bitwarden
*   Thunderbird
*   Syncthing
*   Jitsi
*   AntennaPod
*   Docker
*   Kdenlive
*   Scratch
*   Youtube-dl/yt-dlp
*   Blender
*   PDF Shuffler
*   7-Zip
*   Veracrypt
*   wX
*   GCompris
*   TOR
*   Notepad++
*   Signal
*   Tux Paint
*   Mastodon

Now I asked three different generative AI engines the following:

    Create a list of forty Free Software or Open Source applications that would be useful to end users

Here's what they came up with...

## OpenAI's ChatGPT

    LibreOffice - Office Suite
    GIMP - Image Editing
    Inkscape - Vector Graphics Editor
    Blender - 3D Animation and Graphics
    Scribus - Desktop Publishing
    Audacity - Audio Editing
    Kdenlive - Video Editing
    Shotcut - Video Editing
    OBS Studio - Screen Recording and Live Streaming
    VLC - Media Player
    HandBrake - Video Transcoding
    qBittorrent - Torrent Client
    Transmission - Torrent Client
    Brave - Web Browser
    Mozilla Firefox - Web Browser
    Thunderbird - Email Client
    Evolution - Email Client
    KeePassXC - Password Manager
    VeraCrypt - Disk Encryption
    VirtualBox - Virtualization
    FreeCAD - 3D Modeling
    KiCAD - Electronics Design Automation
    Darktable - RAW Image Processing
    RawTherapee - RAW Image Processing
    Musescore - Music Notation
    Calibre - E-book Management
    PDFsam - PDF Split and Merge
    OBS Studio - Screen Recording and Live Streaming
    OpenShot - Video Editing
    GnuCash - Personal Finance
    Bluefish - Web Development
    Audacious - Audio Player
    Ardour - Digital Audio Workstation
    Krita - Digital Painting
    Pidgin - Instant Messaging
    HexChat - IRC Client
    GnuPG - Email Encryption
    Tor - Anonymity Online
    7-Zip - File Archiver
    FileZilla - FTP Client

Not bad, there's a lot of commonality between that list and mine. Of the things that it added, I had heard of all but
one of them (PDFsam, seems like a freemium app). 

I said "applications" in the question, so it seemed to really focus on things that you can install on an end user 
system. Leaving out some of the network or android based things. This probably means more that I need to refine the 
prompt than anything bad about ChatGPT.

## Microsoft's Bing

    I found a few lists of open-source software that you might find useful. Here are some of the applications that I found:

    1. GIMP - Image editor
    2. LibreOffice - Office suite
    3. VLC Media Player - Media player
    4. Audacity - Audio editor
    5. Inkscape - Vector graphics editor
    6. Blender - 3D graphics creation suite
    7. Krita - Digital painting software
    8. Darktable - Photography workflow application
    9. Kdenlive - Video editor
    10. Handbrake - Video transcoder
    You can find more applications in these lists:

    The best free, open-source software for everyday PC users | PCWorld
    I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions or if there’s anything else I can help you with.

Those are good things, but the list was pretty far short of 40 applications. Interestingly, mostly media focused. I 
responded by asking it to expand the list. 

    That wasn't 40 things, can you expand the list?

It's response, ten more:

    I apologize for the confusion. Here are some more open-source software that you might find useful:

    11. GnuCash - Accounting software
    12. KeePass - Password manager
    13. Calibre - E-book manager
    14. Firefox - Web browser
    15. Thunderbird - Email client
    16. OpenOffice - Office suite
    17. Scribus - Desktop publishing software
    18. Notepad++ - Text editor
    19. VirtualBox - Virtualization software
    20. 7-Zip - File archiver

I guess we could get there, but this seems to take a bit more effort.

## Google's Bard

    These are just a few of the many free software and open source applications that are available. If you are looking for a specific type of application, you can search for it online or ask for recommendations from friends or colleagues.

Like Bing, Bard to the "I want 40 things" as a suggestion...not the biggest deal. Here though it includes an outright 
lie!  

>    CCleaner is a free and open-source system optimization and cleaning tool. 

CCleaner is *not* "free and open-source", it is proprietary software...not a good thing to have in a list like this!

I'm also not so sure that any end users would be interested in MySQL, it seems like it go away from the question off to 
just talking about FLOSS in general there.

## Summary

These AIs are getting pretty decent, if I hadn't spent twenty years learning about FLOSS, I could get a pretty good 
introduction talking to one of them. But I'm happy to have spent that time and been a part of the community for all 
these years. Plus, I've gotten to use a lot of great software!
