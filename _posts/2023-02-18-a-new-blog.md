I've just installed this new static-site generator software, which has blogging built into it. So I'm going to try to 
write a few thoughts from time to time. It probably won't stick...but who knows. 

This blog is a static-site (no databases to get hacked!, but no comments either), built with the 
[jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) platform. I'm using the theme from 
[Mr. Green's Workshop](https://github.com/MrGreensWorkshop/MrGreen-JekyllTheme). Each post is just some 
[markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) with a little bit of [Yaml](https://yaml.org/) at the top for metadata.


P.S. I do realize that I'm only a couple decades late to the party....however this isn't my first attempt at blogging.
