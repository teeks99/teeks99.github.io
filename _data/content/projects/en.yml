        For more than a decade, I've been building the boost binaries for windows/visual studio for each release.

        [Boost Project Site](https://www.boost.org/)

        [Github Scripts for building](https://github.com/teeks99/boost-release-windows) (and issues).

        Get the binaries:

        *   [Primary - boostorg.jfrog.io](https://boostorg.jfrog.io/ui/repos/tree/General/main/release)
        *   [Sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost-binaries/)
        *   [My Site](https://boost.teeks99.com/)

        For many years, I've been maintaining runners that execute the [boost](https://www.boost.org) unit test suite
        for all of the libraries.

        The main configuration for these runners can be found 
        [on github](https://github.com/teeks99/boost-build/tree/master/Regression).

        The results from them can be found here:

        *   [Develop](https://www.boost.org/development/tests/develop/developer/summary.html)
        *   [Master](https://www.boost.org/development/tests/master/developer/summary.html)
